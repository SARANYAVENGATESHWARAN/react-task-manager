## Overview

The Task Manager Web Application is a modern, client-side task management system developed using React. It provides users with an intuitive and responsive interface to manage daily tasks efficiently through features such as task creation, categorization, search, theming, and persistent storage.

The application is designed as a single-page application (SPA) with no backend dependency, making it lightweight, fast, and suitable for offline usage. The project demonstrates professional frontend development practices, including component-based architecture, React Hooks, state persistence, and clean UI design.

## Objectives

  >Enable efficient task creation, modification, completion, and deletion
  
  >Provide task organization using categories and priorities
  
  >Improve usability with search, filtering, and theme customization
  
  >Persist user data using browser localStorage
  
  >Deliver a clean, responsive, and production-ready UI
  
  >Follow industry-standard React development practices

## Application Architecture

    The application follows a component-based architecture with unidirectional data flow:
    
    App.js acts as the root component, managing global state, theme, and persistence.
    
    TaskInput handles task creation and input validation.
    
    TaskList manages task display, filtering, and search.
    
    TaskItem renders individual task data and user actions.
    
    State changes are synchronized with localStorage using useEffect.
    
    This structure ensures maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)

    npm

Modern web browser
## Installation Steps
     npm install

## Run Development Server
    npm start


## Access the application at:
     http://localhost:3000

## Production Build
To generate an optimized production build:

    npm run build


The build output will be available in the build/ directory and is ready for deployment.

## Testing
Testing was conducted manually to validate:

    Task creation and deletion
    
    Completion toggling
    
    Search and filtering behavior
    
    Theme persistence
    
    Data persistence after page refresh
    
    All features function as expected with no runtime errors.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Netlify using a production build generated by Create React App.
Deployment includes automatic HTTPS and optimized static asset delivery.

## Future Enhancements

    Backend integration with authentication
    
    Cloud-based data storage
    
    Drag-and-drop task ordering
    
    Task reminders and notifications
    
    Role-based task assignment
    
    Create React App Information
    
    This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

npm start – Runs the app in development mode

npm test – Launches the test runner

npm run build – Builds the app for production

npm run eject – Ejects configuration (one-way operation)
